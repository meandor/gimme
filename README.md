# GIMME

Basic database abstraction layer. I don't want to care what database I use.
I just want to insert, update, delete and read from it!

GIMME my data and store it. I don't want to care about anything else for now.

Implements only a redis database connection so far.

## Todo
- mongoDB
- cassandra
- arangoDB
- mysql (I guess?)
